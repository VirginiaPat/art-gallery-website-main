## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It is the first project I am using Tailwind, so definitely I learned a lot of new things.

### Useful resources

- [CSS FilterConverter](https://cssfilterconverter.com/) - This helped me to transform specific colors to filters. I used it to change the colors of the social media icons on hover state.
- [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/tailwind-cli)
